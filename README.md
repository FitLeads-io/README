# README - FitLeads.io

FitLeads.io will be a lead generation tool for fitness professionals.

The basic functionality will be to provide a customisable and embeddable calorie calculator for your website. Your users will then be able to calculate their recommended calorie intake depending on their body type and goals. 

In addition to this, it'll collect their name and email address and add their info to your CRM system.

Requirements:
- Customisable styling from within client dashboard
- Generate embeddable code
- Save changes to their account so they don't need to reconfigure their colours, fonts etc every time
- Connect to services like Zapier, ActiveCampaign, HighLevel etc
- Be secure
- Be user friendly

My plan is to offer a generoud free service, with optional upgrade. The only competitor at the moment charges a fixed £15/mo for all accounts. The cut off point for our free plan will likely be based on volume of leads. E.g if you get more than 10 leads per month, it'll cost £10/mo thereafter.

That's all I have for now, but I'll keep this doc up to date with any changes or developments to the plan for FitLeads.io. 

Feel free to reach out and contribute if you're willing! 

All the best,
Jonah
